This project is a Flask-based e-commerce API designed to meet all the required learning objectives for building databases, RESTful services, and serialization layers. The API uses MySQL as its backend and SQLAlchemy 2.0 with DeclarativeBase to define models and relationships. Through this project, I implemented the full database structure requested in the assignment, including a one-to-many relationship between users and orders, as well as a many-to-many relationship between orders and products using an association table. This structure mirrors real-world e-commerce data flow and demonstrates a clear understanding of relational database design.

All API routes were built following RESTful principles and include full CRUD operations for users, products, and orders. The order functionality includes custom endpoints for attaching and removing products from orders while preventing duplicates, which fulfills the many-to-many requirement and adds practical logic to the system. Marshmallow schemas were used for input validation and JSON serialization, and the assignment requirement to enable foreign key visibility using include_fk = True in the Order schema was also completed.

To verify functionality, I tested every route using Postman and added all endpoints to a collection as required. MySQL Workbench was also used to confirm that data was correctly created, updated, and deleted from the database. Overall, this project satisfies the full set of deliverables: a configured MySQL database, SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships, Marshmallow schemas, RESTful CRUD endpoints, and complete testing and verification steps. The API is organized, functional, and aligned with all expectations for the module’s final project and presentation.
